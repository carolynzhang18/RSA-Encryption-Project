# RSA-Simulator
RSA is a form of cryptography that is widely used today to securely transmit data digitally. The algorithm is based in mathematics and involves concepts such as modular arithmetic, Euler's totient function, and Euler's theorem. I created this Java program to supplement the paper and presentation I prepared on this topic as part of a larger project I completed in the Spirit of Math Senior Level Competitive Contest Coaching Club in 2020-21. The program explains how the RSA algorithm works, providing examples, and allows the user to enter messages and simulate the encryption and decryption of these messages using RSA.
